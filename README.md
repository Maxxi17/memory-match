Game Title: Memory
Overview:
"Memory" is a graphical puzzle game that challenges players to match pairs of hidden images. The game utilizes a grid layout where each cell initially displays a default image. Players reveal the images by clicking on the cells and attempt to find matching pairs. The objective is to match all pairs in the fewest possible moves within a limited amount of time.

Gameplay Mechanics:
Game Initialization:

The game window is set to a resolution of 500x400 pixels.
The game grid consists of 16 tiles arranged in a 4x4 matrix.
Each tile hides an image that needs to be matched with its pair.
Image Handling:

The game includes a list of 8 different images, each duplicated once, resulting in 16 images shuffled randomly at the start of the game.
Players click tiles to reveal the images. If two consecutively clicked tiles show matching images, they remain visible. If they do not match, they revert to the default image after a short display.
Scoring and Timing:

The game is timed, with a countdown displayed on the screen. The initial countdown starts from a certain number (not explicitly defined in the script but appears to be configurable).
The score could be interpreted as the remaining time when the player successfully matches all pairs, encouraging faster play for higher scores.
User Interactions:

Players interact with the game by clicking on the tiles.
The game tracks which tiles have been clicked and determines whether the images match.
Game End Conditions:

The game concludes either when all pairs are successfully matched or when the frame counter exceeds a preset maximum frame count, which could represent a time limit or move limit.
Technical Details:
Technology: Built using Python and Pygame, leveraging basic game development techniques such as event handling, image processing, and time management.
Visual Feedback: The game provides immediate visual feedback by updating the display after each action, helping players understand the game state.
Performance: Runs with a fixed frame rate of 60 frames per second, ensuring smooth gameplay.
User Experience:
The interface is straightforward, with a minimalist design focusing on the gameplay.
Textual feedback about the remaining time and final score enhances the competitive aspect of the game.
Conclusion:
"Memory" is a simple yet engaging game that tests the player's memory and quick-thinking skills under time pressure. Its implementation demonstrates fundamental game development concepts with Pygame, making it an excellent project for those learning game programming and user interaction.
